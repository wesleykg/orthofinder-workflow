Human       1. Choose species of interest
Complete    2. Retrieve entries by species ID
Complete    3. Delete duplicate sequences
Complete    4. Muscle align
Incomplete  5. Merge fragments into whole genes
Incomplete  6. Muscle align
Human       7. Final check
Incomplete  8. Assign codon positions
Incomplete  9. Concatenate different genes
