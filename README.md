Proposed workflow for creating single gene aligments using Orthofinder

Human       1. Choose species of interest
Completed   2. Retrieve entries by species ID
Incomplete  3. Delete duplicate sequences
Incomplete  4. Muscle align
Incomplete  5. Merge fragments into whole genes
Incomplete  6. Muscle align
Human       7. Final check
Incomplete  8. Assign codon positions
Incomplete  9. Concatenate different genes
