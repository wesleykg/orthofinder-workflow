Proposed workflow for creating single gene aligments using Orthofinder

1. Choose species of interest
2. Retrieve entries by species ID
3. Delete duplicate sequences
4. Muscle align
5. Merge fragments into whole genes
6. Muscle align
7. Final check
8. Assign codon positions
9. Concatenate different genes
