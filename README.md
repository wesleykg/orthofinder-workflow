Proposed workflow for creating single gene aligments using Orthofinder

Human       1. Choose species of interest

Complete    2. Retrieve entries by species ID

Complete    3. Delete duplicate sequences

Complete    4. Automatic alignment

Incomplete  5. Open in Aliview

Human       5. Merge fragments into whole genes

Incomplete  6. Automatic alignment

Human       7. Final check

Incomplete  8. Assign codon positions

Incomplete  9. Concatenate different genes
